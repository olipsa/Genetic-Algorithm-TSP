# Genetical-Algorithm-TSP
This project was made for Genetical Algorithms class and it contains 2 heuristic methods for solving the TSP(Asymmetric graph) problem: using a genetic algorithm and the Simulated Annealing approach.
In order to run the application you have to add in instances.txt file the graph with: number of nodes and adjacency matrix. Please note that it may take some time for large inputs to run, but the results will appear in rezultate.txt file after finishing the execution.

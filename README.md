# Genetical-Algorithm-TSP
This project was made for Genetical Algorithms class and it contains a heuristic method for solving the TSP(Asymmetric graph) problem: using a genetic algorithm.
In order to run the application you have to add in "instances.txt" file the graph with: number of nodes and adjacency matrix. Then run the TravelingSalesman.exe and select 2 for the genetic algorithm (Simulated Annealing method not included because it was made by a collaborator). Please note that it may take some time for large inputs to run, but the results will appear in "rezultate.txt" file after finishing the execution.
The experimental observations can be found in "[GA]_Lipsa_Ondina_2B_1_Stanciu_Victor_2B1_Tema3.pdf" file.
